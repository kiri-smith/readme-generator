For this project, I built off of a starter code to create a README generator using node.js.  To build this generator, I needed to create a package.json and then installed inquirer as a required program.  I utilized the .prompt method to create a series of prompts that will display when the user runs this application through node.  I also linked this code to a generator function that would take the user's input and add it to a new file, called NewREADME.md.  Finally, I researched information about inserting a license badge to the README, to display the selected license, and added that to my code through a series of License functions.

## Using this application
To use this README generator, the user will clone this github repository to their device.  Next they will use their terminal to open the folder and will run "node index.js" to execute the generator.  The generator will require the user to answer prompt questions, right in their terminal/command line, then will generate a NewREADME.md with their entered information.  See the demo video below for an example of usage.
